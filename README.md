We propose Texture UV Radiance Fields (TUVF), a category-level texture representation disentangled from 3D shapes. Our methods trains from only a collection of real-world images and a set of untextured shapes. Given a 3D shape, TUVF can synthesis realistic, high-fidelity, and diverse 3D consistent textures.
